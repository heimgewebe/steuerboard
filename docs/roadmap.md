# Roadmap

## Phase 0a — Masterplan verankert

Status: complete.

The repository contains the masterplan and README link that establish the planning anchor and core architecture rule.

## Phase 0b — prüfbare Mindeststruktur

Status: core structure plus complete masterplan Pflichtfall example coverage in this commit.

Create the falsification-first repository structure:

- documentation for source, freshness, local scope, redaction, security, and roadmap
- minimal JSON Schemas using Draft 2020-12
- example failure cases
- example validation script
- tests that run validation
- schema files checked against Draft 2020-12 when `jsonschema` is available

No productive scanner, CLI command surface, UI, backend, or action executor is part of this phase. This phase also includes static examples for non-failure-case schemas before Phase 1.

## Phase 1 — Read-only Observation CLI

Status: future work, not part of this commit.

Phase 1 may add `steuerboard observe --json`, but only after the Phase 0b examples and schemas validate. The CLI must observe only and must not assess, decide, or mutate.
